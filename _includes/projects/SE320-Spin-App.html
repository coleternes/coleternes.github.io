  <h3> Spin App </h3>

  <p> This is a mobile application that spins a wheel to randomly select an element from a list,
    and was developed using the Unity engine over the course of a semester with a team of fellow
    engineers. My work primarily focused on the backend where I enabled a singleton design pattern
    which would allow users to create, edit, and delete their own lists. </p>
