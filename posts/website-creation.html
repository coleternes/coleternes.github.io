  <p> Welcome to my first blog post on my newly created website. This is my first
    real experience with HTML and CSS as well as server hosting, and what a fun
    and challenging journey it has been. I've wanted to create my own website for
    a few years now, and now that I am inbetween semesters, I finally have the time
    to do so. To me, the main goal of this website is to show off my software skills
    to companies looking to hire. </p>
