  <p> Welcome to my first blog post on my newly created website. This is my
    first real experience with HTML and CSS as well as server hosting, and what
    a fun and challenging journey it has been. I've wanted to create my own
    website for a few years now, and now that I am inbetween semesters, I
    finally have the time to do so. As of right now, the main goal of this
    website is to show off my software skills to companies looking to hire me.
    But in regards to this blog, I'm not exactly sure what the goal is. I am
    excited to see what I choose to write about in the future, and I hope that
    this will become a sort-of time capsule that I'll be able to look back on in
    the future and reminisce over the simpler days of the pandemic. </p>

  <p> Back to the topic at hand, I started working on this project on January
    10th, 2022. Going into it, I had very little experience with HTML and
    absolutely none with CSS, but this did not discourage me. I began my
    research by googling the best methods to host your own website for computer
    science students, which led me to this
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/269snp/computer_science_student_advice_me_on_webhosting/">reddit post</a>.
    The top comment on the thread recommended a 5 step process: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Get a GitHub account </li>
      <li> Learn git </li>
      <li> Learn Jekyll </li>
      <li> Commit a Jekyll website folder to a github repo labeled "username.github.io" </li>
      <li> Boom free website at https://username.github.io </li>
    </ol>
  <p> This all seemed too easy to me; surely, there must be a catch. But after
    installing Jekyll, generating a Jekyll website folder, and pushing to the
    appropriately named GitHub repo, I found it WAS just that easy. So far, I
    had the default Jekyll template hosted on the GitHub repo, meaning it was
    time to pick a theme. Jekyll provides many
    <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com/resources/">free themes</a>,
    and I settled on
    <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/particle/">Particle</a>,
    which was created by
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nrandecker">Nathan Randecker</a>.
    This left me with the final process of filling in the blanks. </p>

  <p> Surprisingly, this process is what took the longest. Now I'm not here to
    give you a psycho-analysis of my inner-mechanations, so I'll just leave it
    at I'm not the best at bragging about myself. Instead, I'm choosing to view
    this website as a method for cataloguing my progress in regards to software
    development as I continue to learn and advance my skills. I am excited to
    see how far along this website will come, and what software knowledge I will
    learn in the future. And with that, I shall call it a day. </p>
