user_description: Hello, my name is Cole Ternes. I currently attend Chapman University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. During this time, I have gained software engineering experience in several programming languages, become familiar with industry standard tools, and hardened my critical thinking skills. I also wanted a greater understanding of the economy and how the design of new software and software applications may influence the business environment and economic activity.
user_personality: On a more personal note, I am captivated with space exploration and feel a deep responsibility for the environment. For fun, I enjoy the company of good friends and listening to my favorite band, Electric Light Orchestra.
